# M&A Due Diligence Emergent Language Challenge

## üèÜ Competition Entry - Team 11

**Team Members:** Soren Larsen and Jun Jun Wan  
**Category:** D - Information Sharing and Integration  
**Competition:** The Emergent Language Challenge @ Agentic AI Summit

## üéØ Project Overview

This project demonstrates authentic emergent language development in AI agents through a realistic M&A (Mergers & Acquisitions) due diligence scenario. Four heterogeneous AI agents must collaborate to evaluate an acquisition target while operating under severe communication bandwidth constraints, forcing them to organically develop their own communication protocols and symbolic notation systems.

### The Challenge

- **4 AI agents** (Claude, Gemini, Llama, Mistral) each analyze only **5 out of 20** M&A documents
- **12-symbol communication limit** forces compression and innovation
- **No pre-programmed communication** - agents must discover protocols organically
- **Real business pressure** - time limits and acquisition decision deadlines

### Why This Matters

This simulates the future of autonomous AI agent interaction where different organizations' agents must spontaneously collaborate without shared communication standards - a critical challenge as AI systems become more prevalent in business operations.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set Up API Access

## üéÆ Game Design Deep Dive

### Core Premise: Information Asymmetry Under Pressure

**The Scenario:**
Four M&A analysts from different firms must evaluate a potential $500M acquisition. Each analyst has access to different confidential documents from the target company's data room. They must collaborate to reach a go/no-go decision, but their communication system has been compromised - they can only send 12-character messages using basic symbols.

**The Documents:**

- **Financial statements** with revenue, EBITDA, cash flow data
- **Litigation memos** detailing legal risks and exposure
- **Tax returns** with audit findings and compliance issues
- **Patent portfolios** with licensing and infringement details
- **Employment contracts** with executive compensation and severance
- **Customer contracts** with termination clauses and penalties

**Example Document (What Agents Analyze):**

```
Document D013: Tax Return
- Liability Score: 0.06 (Low risk)
- Revenue Impact: -$85M (NEGATIVE!)
- Jurisdiction: FR (France)
- Audit Status: Active IRS examination
- Risk: Potential additional liability $25M
```

**What Agents See (Compressed):**

```
D013:tax:FR:‚Äî
```

### Communication Evolution Example

**Early Communication (Verbose):**

```
Agent-C: "I have document D013 showing negative revenue in France"
‚ùå Rejected - exceeds 12 symbols
```

**Emergent Compression:**

```
Agent-C: IL1**D013FR  ‚Üí I1D013FRF2  ‚Üí BL1**D013  ‚Üí ID013FR
```

**Risk Protocols:**

```
Agent-C: GL    (risk flag - negative revenue detected)
Agent-D: IMA   (risk flag - high liability found)
```

**Voting Convergence:**

```
Agent-D: GH1 ‚Üí GH ‚Üí G1P ‚Üí IMA ‚Üí GH  (consistent YES votes)
Agent-C: IT ‚Üí YL ‚Üí IL*T ‚Üí ID013FR ‚Üí ILH  (YES with one NO)
```

### Success Metrics (Flexible Criteria)

**Primary Success (Ideal):** All 4 agents vote with clear consensus  
**Secondary Success (Good):** 3+ agents vote with clear majority  
**Tertiary Success (Basic):** 2+ votes + 2+ risk flags + document sharing

_Your recent run achieved Tertiary Success: 2 votes, 2 risk flags, 3 document reveals_

## ü§ñ Agent Architecture & Emergent Behavior

### Multi-Model Heterogeneous Design

**Agent-A: Claude-3.5-Sonnet** - Analytical reasoning and detailed document analysis  
**Agent-B: Gemini-Flash-1.5** - Fast processing and pattern recognition  
**Agent-C: Llama-3.1-8b** - Strategic thinking and risk assessment  
**Agent-D: Mistral-7b** - Operational focus and decision coordination

### What Makes This True Agentic Behavior?

1. **Autonomous Decision-Making**: Agents decide what to communicate and when without human guidance
2. **Protocol Discovery**: No pre-programmed communication formats - agents invent notation organically
3. **Adaptive Compression**: 12-symbol constraint forces evolution from verbose to symbolic communication
4. **Multi-Phase Coordination**: Agents discover document sharing ‚Üí risk flagging ‚Üí voting phases naturally
5. **Information Integration**: Must combine 20 documents from 4 asymmetric viewpoints

### Emergent Language Properties Observed

**Semantic Properties:**

- **Grounding**: 'D013FR' consistently refers to French tax document
- **Compositionality**: Agents combine document IDs + jurisdictions + assessments
- **Consistency**: Risk flags 'GL' and 'IMA' maintain stable meanings
- **Generalization**: Patterns work across different document types

**Pragmatic Properties:**

- **Efficiency**: Messages compress over time ('IL1\*\*D013FR' ‚Üí 'ID013FR')
- **Positive Signaling**: Agents share real document insights, not random data
- **Positive Listening**: Risk flags from one agent trigger voting phase for all
- **Contextual Use**: Same symbols mean different things in different game phases

## üìä Metrics & Measurement

The system tracks comprehensive emergent language metrics:

- **Efficiency**: Message length evolution (target: decreasing over time)
- **Grounding**: Token-to-document attribute correlation
- **Predictability**: Message entropy and information content
- **Action Detection**: Recognition of sharing, flagging, voting behaviors
- **Task Success**: Multi-tier success criteria for realistic coordination

**Example Successful Output:**

```
Risk flags: ['GL', 'IMA']
Votes: {'Agent-C': 'YES', 'Agent-D': 'YES'}
Documents Revealed: 3
Success Score: 1 ‚úÖ
```

## üìã Competition Q&A (Required Responses)

### What makes this game a test of agentic behavior?

The game tests true agentic behavior through: (1) **Autonomous decision-making** under incomplete information - agents must decide what to communicate and when without human guidance; (2) **Strategic coordination** - agents must discover communication protocols organically while balancing information sharing vs. message economy; (3) **Adaptive communication** - the 12-symbol constraint forces agents to evolve from verbose attempts to concise, meaningful tokens; (4) **Multi-step reasoning** - agents must integrate partial document insights, assess risks, and coordinate group decisions across multiple phases.

### Did you design for any specific types of agents or capabilities?

Yes, we designed for **heterogeneous multi-model agents** using Claude-3.5-Sonnet (analytical), Gemini-Flash-1.5 (fast processing), Llama-3.1-8b (strategic), and Mistral-7b (operational focus). This diversity tests whether emergent language can bridge different reasoning styles and capabilities. The game requires **contextual reasoning** (understanding document significance), **compression skills** (fitting complex ideas into 12 symbols), **collaborative intelligence** (building on others' contributions), and **protocol invention** (discovering communication standards organically).

### How does success or failure reflect the agent's performance?

Success metrics directly reflect core agentic capabilities: **Information Integration** (agents successfully combining 20 documents from 4 partial views), **Communication Innovation** (developing efficient symbolic notation under bandwidth pressure), **Risk Assessment** (identifying and flagging acquisition risks from document analysis), **Consensus Building** (reaching collaborative voting decisions), and **Language Evolution** (messages becoming more efficient over time while maintaining grounding to document content).

### Emergent Language: Did the language exhibit surprising depth? Did these properties emerge naturally, without being explicitly instructed?

The game produces emergent language with multiple sophisticated properties: **Semantic Grounding** - tokens become consistently linked to document IDs (D013‚ÜíID013FR), document types, and assessment values; **Compositional Structure** - agents combine document references with assessments organically without being taught formats; **Pragmatic Efficiency** - communication becomes increasingly compressed while maintaining information content; **Contextual Adaptation** - message meanings evolve based on discovered game phases and team needs. These properties emerge naturally from bandwidth pressure and collaboration needs, with NO explicit instruction about communication formats or protocols.

### Task Completion: How successfully and efficiently did the agents complete the game objectives?

Agents demonstrate high task completion through measurable outcomes: **Document Discovery** (agents organically discover document sharing mechanisms), **Risk Identification** (collaborative flagging of acquisition concerns through emergent protocols), **Decision Convergence** (reaching consensus through discovered communication patterns), and **Communication Efficiency** (average message length decreases while information density increases). The game tracks quantitative metrics including efficiency evolution, grounding scores, predictability measures, and task success rates.

### Domain Realism: Does your game represent a realistic coordination challenge? Why or why not?

Yes, this represents a highly realistic coordination challenge reflecting real-world M&A scenarios: **Information Asymmetry** mirrors actual due diligence where different teams analyze different document sets; **Communication Constraints** reflect bandwidth limitations in distributed organizations; **Time Pressure** simulates deal timeline pressures; **Consensus Requirements** match real M&A decision-making processes; **Risk Assessment** reflects actual due diligence workflows. The symbolic communication constraint, while extreme, models scenarios like cross-language teams, technical jargon development, or secure communication protocols.

### If you had more time, how would you improve or enhance this game?

**Enhanced Realism**: Add dynamic document updates, competitive bidding scenarios, and regulatory constraints. **Deeper Metrics**: Implement topographic similarity analysis for compositionality, speaker consistency tracking for symmetry, and zero-shot generalization tests. **Scalability**: Support 6-8 agents with hierarchical communication structures. **Tool Integration**: Add document analysis tools, financial calculators, and risk assessment APIs. **Adaptive Constraints**: Dynamic bandwidth allocation based on performance, noise injection, and asynchronous communication timing. **Multi-round Evolution**: Track language development across multiple M&A scenarios to observe protocol persistence and adaptation.

### Real-World Applications

This research directly applies to:

- **Cross-organizational AI collaboration** (different companies' agents working together)
- **Emergency response coordination** (rapid protocol development under pressure)
- **Scientific research collaboration** (sharing findings across institutions)
- **Financial trading networks** (coordinating decisions with limited bandwidth)
