# M&A Due Diligence Emerg## Agent Design

### What makes this game a test of agentic behavior?

The game tests true agentic behavior through: (1) **Autonomous decision-making** under incomplete information - agents must decide what to communicate and when without human guidance; (2) **Strategic coordination** - agents must discover communication protocols organically while balancing information sharing vs. message economy; (3) **Adaptive communication** - the 12-symbol constraint forces agents to evolve from verbose attempts to concise, meaningful tokens; (4) **Multi-step reasoning** - agents must integrate partial document insights, assess risks, and coordinate group decisions across multiple phases.

### Did you design for any specific types of agents or capabilities?

Yes, we designed for **heterogeneous multi-model agents** using Claude-3.5-Sonnet (analytical), Gemini-Flash-1.5 (fast processing), Llama-3.1-8b (strategic), and Mistral-7b (operational focus). This diversity tests whether emergent language can bridge different reasoning styles and capabilities. The game requires **contextual reasoning** (understanding document significance), **compression skills** (fitting complex ideas into 12 symbols), **collaborative intelligence** (building on others' contributions), and **protocol invention** (discovering communication standards organically).

### How does success or failure reflect the agent's performance?

Success metrics directly reflect core agentic capabilities: **Information Integration** (agents successfully combining 20 documents from 4 partial views), **Communication Innovation** (developing efficient symbolic notation under bandwidth pressure), **Risk Assessment** (identifying and flagging acquisition risks from document analysis), **Consensus Building** (reaching unanimous voting decisions), and **Language Evolution** (messages becoming more efficient over time while maintaining grounding to document content).guage Challenge

### Title of Your Game: M&A Due Diligence Emergent Language Challenge

### Describe the game:

Four AI agents act as M&A analysts evaluating an acquisition target. Each agent has access to only 5 documents from a 20-document due diligence data room, creating asymmetric information that requires collaboration. The agents must work together under severe communication constraints (12 symbols maximum per message using only A-Z, 0-9, +-\*/\_<>) to organically discover how to share findings, identify risks, and reach a collective acquisition decision. The game tracks comprehensive emergent language metrics including efficiency, grounding, compositionality, and task success.

## Evaluation

### Emergent Language: Did the language exhibit surprising depth? Did these properties emerge naturally, without being explicitly instructed?

The game produces emergent language with multiple sophisticated properties: **Semantic Grounding** - tokens become consistently linked to document IDs (D001→D1), document types, and assessment values; **Compositional Structure** - agents combine document references with assessments organically without being taught formats; **Pragmatic Efficiency** - communication becomes increasingly compressed while maintaining information content; **Contextual Adaptation** - message meanings evolve based on discovered game phases and team needs. These properties emerge naturally from bandwidth pressure and collaboration needs, with NO explicit instruction about communication formats or protocols.

### Task Completion: How successfully and efficiently did the agents complete the game objectives?

Agents demonstrate high task completion through measurable outcomes: **Document Discovery** (agents organically discover document sharing mechanisms), **Risk Identification** (collaborative flagging of acquisition concerns through emergent protocols), **Decision Convergence** (reaching consensus through discovered communication patterns), and **Communication Efficiency** (average message length decreases while information density increases). The game tracks quantitative metrics including efficiency evolution, grounding scores, predictability measures, and task success rates.

### Domain Realism: Does your game represent a realistic coordination challenge? Why or why not?

Yes, this represents a highly realistic coordination challenge reflecting real-world M&A scenarios: **Information Asymmetry** mirrors actual due diligence where different teams analyze different document sets; **Communication Constraints** reflect bandwidth limitations in distributed organizations; **Time Pressure** simulates deal timeline pressures; **Consensus Requirements** match real M&A decision-making processes; **Risk Assessment** reflects actual due diligence workflows. The symbolic communication constraint, while extreme, models scenarios like cross-language teams, technical jargon development, or secure communication protocols.

## Additional Questions

### If you had more time, how would you improve or enhance this game?

**Enhanced Realism**: Add dynamic document updates, competitive bidding scenarios, and regulatory constraints. **Deeper Metrics**: Implement topographic similarity analysis for compositionality, speaker consistency tracking for symmetry, and zero-shot generalization tests. **Scalability**: Support 6-8 agents with hierarchical communication structures. **Tool Integration**: Add document analysis tools, financial calculators, and risk assessment APIs. **Adaptive Constraints**: Dynamic bandwidth allocation based on performance, noise injection, and asynchronous communication timing. **Multi-round Evolution**: Track language development across multiple M&A scenarios to observe protocol persistence and adaptation.
